# Hi ! My name is Thibault GAREL üòä 

I am currently in my 4th year at ECE Paris, an engineering school, where I am pursuing a Major in Data and Artificial Intelligence.

Since 2023, I‚Äôve been building personal projects at the intersection of **AI, physics, and experimental ideas**.

## üåü Featured Projects  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Neural Network in C (from scratch)**  
Manual implementation of a neural network (forward/backprop, activation functions) with no external libraries, except Allegro for visualization.  
Started in 2023 to better grasp the fundamentals.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Snake ‚Äì Deep Q-Learning**  
Agent trained to play Snake using reinforcement learning.  
Libraries: TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Numpy.  
Not fully conclusive, but strong hands-on RL experience.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Snake ‚Äì Genetic Algorithm**  
Evolutionary approach to the Snake game: neural networks evolving through selection, crossover, and mutation.  
Libraries: Neat, Matplotlib, Numpy.  
Started in 2023, with very good results.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Convolutional GAN ‚Äì Image Generation**  
GAN trained to generate images from noise.  
Libraries: PyTorch, Matplotlib, Numpy.  
Trained on cat images ‚Äî promising results, though very resource-intensive.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Spontaneous Membrane Formation (Experimental)**  
Simulation attempt of emergent membrane-like structures based on spatial dynamics (attraction/repulsion rules).  
Incomplete, more exploratory than functional.  

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Realistic Physics Modeling**  
Coding classical physics equations (gravity, repulsion, collisions) in Python and C.  
Goal: turn theory into visual simulations.  

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Empty Interface Template**  
Minimal frontend/backend setup for future AI projects.  
Currently boilerplate, designed for reusability.
